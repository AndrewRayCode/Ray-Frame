Dependencies

express
    URL: 
        https://github.com/visionmedia/express
    Instructions:
        Clone and install with npm install

nodeunit
    URL:
        https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit 
    Instructions:
        Same as above

My fork of node-couchdb
    URL:
        https://github.com/DelvarWorld/node-couchdb

    Instructions:
        You can see how I'm including it in server.js. For now it's just a relative reference.
        Sorry, you have to deal, and clone the repo to the same local path (put in same folder ray-frame is in).

CouchDb
    URL:
        For Windows I suggest CouchIO http://www.couch.io/get

How to start Ray-Frame
----------------------
You must have a CouchDB instance running to start. Simply run:

> node server.js

And then hit http://localhost:8080/ and you will see your test website! All of the code is currently in server.js

How to run the tests
--------------------
nodeunit test/tests.js

Basic Technical Overview + Rules
--------------------------------
- I have a basic workflow diagram mapped out, I will add it to this file or the Wiki at some point
- There are TODOs all over the code. Feel free to pick one and work on it
- Any client to server communication should receive a JSON response with at minumum {status: (one of) ['failure', 'warning', 'success', 'processing']
- All client-side JavaScript admin functionality goes on the RayFrame object
